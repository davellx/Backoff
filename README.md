# Backoff
My Personal Framework for small websites

It's very incomplete, needs lot of refactoring and enhancement but it works for my basic needs : 
- be (very) small, unlike Laravel or Symfony
- be able to load external libraries 
- be understood fast

I've added some examples but what is really needed at first is documentation.
